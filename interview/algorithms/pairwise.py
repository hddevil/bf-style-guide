# Given an array arr, find element pairs 
# whose sum equal the second argument arg 
# and return the sum of their indices.
#
# You may use multiple pairs that have the 
# same numeric elements but different indices. 
# Each pair should use the lowest possible 
# available indices. Once an element has been 
# used it cannot be reused to pair with another 
# element. For instance, pairwise([1, 1, 2], 3) 
# creates a pair [2, 1] using the 1 at index 0 
# rather than the 1 at index 1, because 0+2 < 1+2.
