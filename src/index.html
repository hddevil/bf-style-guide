                <p>Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and is notable for its extreme
                minimalism.</p>
                <p>The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>increment/decrement the data pointer</li>
                    <li>increment/decrement the byte at the data pointer</li>
                    <li>output the byte at the data pointer</li>
                    <li>accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.</li>
                    <li>if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero/zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer back/forward to the next command, jump it back/forward to the command after the
                    matching</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.
                Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.</p>

                <p><span class='keyword'>Comments:</span> you can use [ ] to place a comment describing the program in them, but you should not use them in the code, because the
                current cell may not be equal to 0 and the loop will run, thus disrupting the program.</p>

    <span class='comment'>This loop is an "initial comment loop", a simple way of adding a comment
    to a BF program such that you don't have to worry about any command
    characters. Any ".", ",", "+", "-", "<" and ">" characters are simply 
    ignored, the "[" and "]" characters just have to be balanced. This 
    loop and the commands it contains are ignored because the current cell 
    defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.</span>

                <p><span class='keyword'>Description:</span> at the beginning of each program, you must specify a description of what it does, what data it accepts for input, and

                account when processing data to avoid byte overflow.</p>
                <p><span class='keyword'>Input:</span> you should add a comment about what the program accepts (numbers / strings) and the number of characters it accepts.</p>
                <p><span class='keyword'>Output:</span> you should add a comment with an example of what the program should output if its output is based on some input data.
                This will help you quickly find out if there is an error in the program.</p>
